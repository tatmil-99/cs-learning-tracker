## Projects In the Works :construction:

### JavaScript Library App

I've been working intermittently on this for a friend who is an avid reader. You're more than welcome to check out the [repo](https://github.com/tatmil-99/JavaScriptLibrary).

## Potential Future Projects :crystal_ball:

### Job Application Boomerang

I use Google Sheets to document jobs I apply to and the dates in which I apply, so my idea is to grab my data from Sheets and create a tool that enables me to remind myself to reach out to prospective employers "X" days later. I use the Boomerang extension for Chrome, but unless i'm cold reaching to employers via email, it doesn't quite fit my needs... Maybe eventually, however, this could be a neat extension?

### Maybe a New Website???

I love my [website](https://tatienmiller.com) I recently built, but I have kind of been obsessed with 90's themed things as of lateley, so I think a 90's themed website with some modern infusions would be really awesome!

### A Restaurant Landing Page

I'm trying to score a build for a local restaurant that makes some pretty good homestyle food. Nothing crazy, just a simple build that displays their menu, prices, contact info, and directions via Google's Maps API.

### A Secret App

I have an idea for a web app i'm super psyched for. It hasn't really been done yet--at least well--so i'm not publicly putting any info... even tho this page isn't likely to be seen many times.
