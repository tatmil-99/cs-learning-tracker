# Programming Education Tracker :open_file_folder:

This is a log of my computer science resources, interests, and other code related things. It's a way to keep track of my learning and organize my notes and progress.

## Projects In the Works :construction:

### JavaScript Library App

I've been working intermittently on this for a friend who is an avid reader. You're more than welcome to check out the [repo](https://github.com/tatmil-99/JavaScriptLibrary).

## Potential Future Projects :crystal_ball:

### Pollen Tracker

I would like to build a pollen tracker to better my knowledge and experience with APIs, but also to help manage my horrible allergies.

### Maybe a New Website???

I love my [website](https://tatienmiller.com) I recently built, but I have kind of been obsessed with 90's themed things as of lateley, so I think a 90's themed website with some modern infusions would be really awesome!
