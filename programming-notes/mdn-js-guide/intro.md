# Intro to JS

JavaScript - Interpreted/just-in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language used to makes web pages dynamic.

- JS allows for manipulation of host environment objects (DOM).
- JS also allows for access to server side operations via Node.js.
- Uses prototype-based model for objects, rather than classes, which allows for dynamic inheritance.
- Properties and methods can be added dynamically to objects.
- JS variable data types are not declared (loosely typed).
