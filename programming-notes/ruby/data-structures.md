# Data Structures

## Tips

When deciding to use a hash or an array, ask yourself a few questions:

- Does the data need to be in order? If yes, then use an array.

- Does the data need to be associated with a label? If yes, then use a hash.

- Do you need a stack or queue structure? If yes, then use an array.
