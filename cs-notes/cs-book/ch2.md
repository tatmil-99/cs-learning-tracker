# C++ Semantics, Syntax, and the Development Process

## C++ Program Structure

Function - A subprogram. C++ programs consist of functions.

Main - Function required in C++. Is called by the OS. Returns 0 if everything went ok.

Syntax - Grammer rules for programming languages--written by metalanguages.

Semantics - The meaning of instructions in a programming language.

Metalanguage - A language used to write the rules for syntax.

Indentifier - A name associated with a function or data located in memory. Must start with a-z, A-Z, or "\_". Can include 0-9.

Data type - Determines operations that can be performed and how values are represented in the computer.

Collating sequence - Ordering of characters ex. ('a' < 'b').

- Programs act on data, whether internal data in memory, external data, or inputs/outputs.

### Data types:

- Char - Values that consist of one alphanumeric character. Single quoted.

- String - Data that consists of more than one char. Double quoted. Must not be longer than one line. Strings with no chars, or spaces are "null strings". Not built in... supplied by standard library.
