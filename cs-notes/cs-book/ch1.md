# Programming and Problem Solving

Computer - A programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data.

## What Is Programming?

Programming - Developing a set of instructions for a computer to follow to solve a problem.

Program - A set of instructions for a computer to follow.

## How To Write a Program?

### Three Phases:

Problem-solving Phase:

- Understand the Problem and expected output.
- Develop an algorithm.
- Test algorithm.

Implementation Phase:

- Translate algorithm to program language.
- Test program.

Maintenance Phase:

- Use program.
- Update program when bugs/changes arise.

## What Is an Algorithm?

Algorithm - Set of instructions to solve a problem in a finite amount of time.

## What Is a Programming Language?

Programming language - An english-like language consisting of symbols and rules to code algorithms into programs.

Documentation - Text and comments to help others understand your program.

Data - Information in a form the computer/program can use.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Binary Representations of Data

Bit - AKA binary digit. Represents a single 1 or 0.

Byte - Represents group of 8 bits.

Short word - 16-Bit.

Long word - 64-bit.

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

Unicode - New information interchange system--includes more than the english language.

- Single characters are typically represented as 1 or 2 bytes.
- Data is represented in computers as electronic pulses.
- Binary(base-two) is a good way to represent data in computers because it is either on(1) or off(0), like electricity.
- Most programming languages use ASCII to represent characters as bytes.
- Unicode is represented by storing 2 bytes of data in memory.

## How Does a Computer Run a Program?

Machine code - Binary coded instructions.

Assembly language - A step up from machine code -- instructions represented as mnemonics, or easy to remember letters.

Assembler - Program that translates assembly language into machine code.

Compiler - Program that translates high level languages into machine code.

Source program - Program/data to be translated by compiler.

Object program - Source program translated to machine code.

Compilation vs. Interpretation - The former translates entire program into mc before execting, while the latter translates line-by-line.

- All data within a computer's memory exists as binary codes.
- Instructions and data are represented the same -- this allows computers to run their own instructions as data.
- High-level standardized languages are portable, whereas assembly or machine language is not because each computer has its own machine language.
- During execution the compiled code is loaded into memory and ran.
