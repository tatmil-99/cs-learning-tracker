## How To Write a Program?

### Three Phases:

Problem-solving Phase:

- Understand the Problem and expected output.
- Develop an algorithm.
- Test algorithm.

Implementation Phase:

- Translate algorithm to program language.
- Test program.

Maintenance Phase:

- Use program.
- Update program when bugs/changes arise.

## What Is an Algorithm?

Algorithm - Set of instructions to solve a problem in a finite amount of time.

## What Is a Programming Language?
